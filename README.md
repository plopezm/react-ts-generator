# react-ts-generator
Creates typescript react project with lower footprint than create-react-app. 
I have created it because I noticed that create-react-app is quite big now. 
In future commits I will add features such as store configuration.

# How to execute

It is a bash script, in windows you can use [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to execute it.

Just type: 
```
./<path_to_react_ts_project_script_folder>/start-react-ts-project.sh <path/to/project/folder/project_name>
```
